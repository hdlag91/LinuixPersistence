Now you will get the chance to test out the persistence live version of Linux! Hopefully, you will enjoy using the device so much you may want to install the full version. We will also make some minor changes on your account, verifying that you do have a persistence saved Linux OS.

You boot options should still be the same if you were previously on a Linux live version.

You will have a new menu that appears called the GRUB. This is the interface you would normally see that takes precedent to choose which OS you would like to run.

:radio_button: Choose the first option <b>persistent live</b><br>
:radio_button: Wait for ubuntu to load.<br>

Ubuntu will take a bit to load when booting vs a full install. You may also have a black screen showing information of failure. It will bypass this and continue to boot into ubuntu.

After the loading process is complete, you will be presented with the interface that a live version of ubuntu looks like when first approaching. The taskbar will be on the left
and have the preloaded applications available. It will also have the default background that you would see on a live version.
