Learning how to use Linux is critical for anyone interested in the tech industry. Linux is a free, open-source operating system that gives you freedom that neither macOS or Windows can achieve. Linux allows you to customize how you want the software to operate and not worry about clogging your OS with useless applications. In terms of security vulnerabilities Linux can be solved and caught sooner compared to Windows due to being open-source with countless users contributing to Linux improvements.
