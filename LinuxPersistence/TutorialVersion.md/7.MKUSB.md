Now that everything is accounted for, we can move forward with flashing the persistent Linux distro on the flash drive of your choice. Now you can do this from the [command line as well]() but for now I will show you with the graphical interface.

Before we start, go ahead and plug in the USB you want to flash Linux to. The usb should already be mounted when it's plugged in. However, you need to know where the USB is mounted at. You can check this real quick.

:radio_button:Plug in the usb you will write Linux to.<br>
:radio_button:Open up a new terminal (CTRL+ALT+T).<br>
:radio_button:type if the following command: `df`.<br>

The command `df` displays the filesystems that are currently mounted for your computer as well the path they are located at. 

:radio_button: Find the filesystem that your usb is mounted on. In this tutorial, I'm looking for <b>USBRED</b>. Your name for the USB drive may be different.

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/LinuxUSBLocation.png">
<br><i>Figure 7.1: All filesystem locations currently mounted.</i></kbd><br><br>

:radio_button: Either memorize what filesystem the USB is mounted on or minimize the terminal for it. You'll need it when selecting the correct file path.<br>

:radio_button: Go back to the previous terminal you were using.<br>

:radio_button: Type in the following command on the terminal: `mkusb`<br

You should be presented with the following screen:<br>

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/Linuxmkusbcommand.png"><br><i>Figure 7.2: Mkusb version selection.</i></kbd><br><br>

:radio_button: Type `d` as your selection. This will give the newest interface that mkusb created.<br>
:radio_button: You'll get a "Do Stuff" screen that pops up warning you the device you will select will be overwritten. Click Ok.<br>

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/LinuxDoStuffDUS.png"><br><i>Figure 7.3: Overwriting warning.</i></kbd><br><br>

:radio_button: Select of type "i" for installing a live usb.<br>

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/Linuxinstallmakeabootdevice.png"><br><i>Figure 7.4: General command you want to do.</i></kbd><br><br>

:radio_button: Select p or "persistent-live" for debian and ubuntu iso.<br>

<h3><b>:notebook_with_decorative_cover: Heads Up! :notebook_with_decorative_cover:</b></h3>

After this step you may have a screen pop up saying a quick boot choice. This may happen if you have plugged in your new USB already. If not, it shouldn't pop up or may be asking you to overwrite your main drive (Which may be Windows in this case). Click the X in the top right corner.

:radio_button: Find the file location for the linux iso you want to burn.<br>

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/LinusISOlocation.png"><br><i>Figure 7.6: Ubuntu iso location.</i></kbd><br><br>


:radio_button: On the `Select target device` screen, choose the usb where it is mounted. This is what I mean for knowing where the USB you want to flash is located at.<br>

<h3><b>:bangbang: Warning :bangbang:</b></h3>
:interrobang::interrobang::interrobang:

Be very careful as to not accidentally overwrite your main drive. That will be indicated by the <b>built in device</b> under the <b>kind of device</b> setting.

:radio_button: For the live drive settings, select the `upefi`. Upefi uses the grub system off the ISO file and works with multiple computer manufacturers.<br>

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/Linuxdrivesettings.png"><br><i>Figure 7.8: Persistent drive settings.</i></kbd><br><br>

:radio_button: Assign how much persistence you want to give your USB stick. The default is 50, which means the other 50 percent of your usb drive will be used for storage.<br>

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/Linuxpersistenceallowed.png"><br><i>Figure 7.9: Persistent percentage slider.</i></kbd><br><br>

:radio_button: Select Go on the final checkpoint screen.<br>
:radio_button: Wait for the process to finish. either keep an eye on the terminal or the gui if you have it pulled up.<br>

<br><br><kbd><img src="/LinuxPersistence/img/Linuxmkusbprogress.png"><br><i>Figure 7.10: Persistent progression. </i></kbd><br><br>

:radio_button: Exit out of the remaining windows that pop up for mkusb.<br>
:radio_button: If not already unmounted, unmount the usb you just flashed the persistence saving usb to.<br>
:radio_button: Remove the device from the usb drive.<br>
